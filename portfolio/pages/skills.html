        <p>HTML and CSS are essential tools for building a website, and every developer should have a solid understanding of how to use them. In this project, I will demonstrate my skills in HTML and CSS by showcasing various websites and featured projects. These websites will include responsive layouts using CSS Grid, CSS Flexbox, and media queries, along with interesting CSS styling.</p>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <p>JavaScript brings your website to life, and every website should have at least one JavaScript program included in its files. For this reason, I decided to use JavaScript alongside CSS to create an interactive website.</p>
